# MobileManager-Public
Public version of MobileManager repository.

### Purpose
MobileManager accesses the North Carolina voter registration database and presents available information in a user-friendly format. Data are stored locally in a SQLite database (through the Core Data framework), so the application supports filtering voters by most available parameters (age, location, etc.) to facilitate targeted voter interactions.
